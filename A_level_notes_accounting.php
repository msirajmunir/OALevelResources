</div><div>If donation is for a day to day expenditure or will remain with the club only for a short period then it should be treated as an income in the income and expenditure account.

</div><div>The club receives money for subscription for the entire life of the member. This is put in a separate life membership account. Every year an amount of it is transferred to the income and expenditure account (this will be given in the question), e.g. the amount of money received from this life membership scheme is $300 and club decides to transfer 20% every year. This would mean that $60 (20% of $300) is transferred to income and expenditure account and the remainder $240 should go to the balance sheet as a long term liability. If the life membership fund already has a balance, let’s say $2 000 and we have received $500 during the year and club transfers 10% year.</div><p></p></div>

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>What if there is no partnership agreement?
</strong><div><strong>
</strong></div><div>The partnership Act of 1890 will apply which states No interest on capital or drawings
</div><div>
</div><div><strong>1. No Salaries
</strong></div><div><strong>2. Profits to be shared equally ( Not in capital ratio)
</strong></div><div><strong>3. Interest on Loan from partner ( if not stated) is taken at 5%.
</strong></div><div>
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>What is a partnership change? 
</strong></div><div>
</div><div>A partnership change occurs when there is a change in structure of the partnership . The partnership is not dissolved it is only changed. i.e Admission of a new partner, Retirement of an existing partner , or simply a change in existing profit sharing ratio. 
</div><div>
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Why do we have to treat for goodwill in a partnership change? 
</strong></div><div>
</div><div>Any goodwill generated till date belongs to the old partners. So the goodwill adjustment is done in such a way that old partners will benefit and the new partners will loose out. </div><div>This is because goodwill is kept in line with the profit sharing ratio.</div><div><br></div><div>The new partner ends up paying for goodwill and the old partner if he is leaving gets paid for his goodwill. This way all partners are treated fairly.
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>How do we have to treat for goodwill in a partnership change?
</strong></div><div>There are two methods to treat goodwill
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Method 1: Goodwill is kept in the books
</strong></div><div>In this method we create goodwill in the old profit sharing ratio in capital accounts and leave it ( so that it can be shown in the balance sheet as a non current asset). This method is rarely used and is not prefered because it’s not in line with the Prudence and Money Measurement Concept.</div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div><strong>Method 2: Goodwill is Created but then written off right away
</strong></div><div>In this method we create goodwill in the old profit sharing ratio in capital accounts but then write it off in the new profit sharing ratio. This method is frequently used and follows Prudence and Money Measurement Concept.
</div><div>Note: If Question doesn’t specify clearly always use method 2</div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div><strong>What if Goodwill is already recorded on the balance and has to be adjusted?
</strong></div><div>The amount of goodwill on the balance sheet is already in capital accounts of the partner so we only need to create the difference ( increase ) in the goodwill in old profit sharing ratio ( and then write off the entire amount if required to write it off. Alternate method would be to treat the change in goodwill in revaluation account and then write i off the full amount from the capital account.</div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div><strong>What is the difference between revaluation account and realization (dissolution) account?
</strong></div><div>Revaluation account is made at the time of change in a partnership ( see above) . This is done to change the values of asset to the current market value so that any gain or loss that has arise before the change can be adjusted in capital of partners. When making revaluation account if only take the changes in assets ( the difference in values) and close it off in the old profit sharing ratio
</div><div>Realization account is made when the partnership business is dissolved or sold . The aim of this account is to calculate the overall gain or loss upon closure of the partnership business. In this we first close the assets at net book value and compare it with the amount realized upon sale . The difference (overall gain or loss) is closed off in the profit sharing ratio as well.
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>What are the possible reasons for dissolution in a partnership?</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>&gt;&gt;</strong> &nbsp;Business is making losses and future prospects are not good.
</div><div><strong>&gt;&gt;</strong> &nbsp;Death/Retirement of a partner ( Specially in case of two partners in a partnership)Legal</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">authorities have forced the business to close down</span><br></div><div><strong>&gt;&gt;</strong> &nbsp;Dispute between the partners
</div><div><strong>&gt;&gt;</strong>	Business is very illiquid and about to get bankrupt
</div><div><strong>&gt;&gt; </strong>&nbsp;Partners want to form a limited company.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><u>PURCHASE AND SALE OF BUSINESS</u></strong></div><div><strong><u><br></u></strong></div><div>Purchased Goodwill is calculated by the company which is buying the business. The formula used is
</div><div><strong>PURCHASE CONSIDERATION (PURCHASE PRICE) – FAIR VALUE OF NET ASSETS ACQUIRED</strong>.
</div><div><br></div><div>IF THE GOODWILL IS NEGATIVE IT IS RECORED AS A NEGATIVE ASSET IN
</div><div>THE BALANCE SHEET that is in brackets. It is called negative goodwill. We also use to call it capital reserve.
</div><div><br></div><div>The Business which is being sold will not calculate goodwill, in fact it will calculate gain or loss on realization (sale), which will be done through a realization account
</div><div><br></div><div>Following Table is useful to summarize the differences in Sale and Purchase of Business

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Reserves
</strong><div>The net assets of the company are represented with capital and reserves. While Capital represents the claim that owners have because of the number of shares they own, reserves represent the claim that owners have because of the wealth created by the company over the years but not distributed to them. There are two main types of reserves.
</div><div>Revenue Reserves: The reserves which arise from profit (Trading activities of the company) . These are transferred from the Appropriation Account. Examples include General Reserve and Retained Profit (Profit and Loss) .Dividends can only be paid to the amount of revenue reserves on the balance sheet. I.e. the maximum dividend possible is the sum of both revenue reserves.
</div><div>Capital Reserves:These are reserves which the company is required to set up by law and cannot be distributed as dividends. They normally arise out of capital transactions. These include Share Premium and Revaluation Reserve and also Capital Redemption Reserve (See details of CRR)</div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div><strong>Revaluation Reserve
</strong></div><div>This is created when the value of an asset is increased in the books due to a permanent increase in market value. The amount of revaluation reserve is difference between net book value at the time of revaluation and the market value. This is a gain which cannot be transferred to the profit and loss account as it is still not realized (earned) by the company. This reserve can be used in the future if the same asset (on which the reserve was created) value goes down ( the loss can be written off against this reserve). This can also be used for Bonus Issue
.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Share Premium
</strong></div><div>Share premium occurs when a company issues shares at a price above its nominal (par) value. This excess of share price over nominal value is what is known as share premium.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>What are the uses of Share Premium?
</strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;"></span></div><div><strong>&gt;&gt;</strong> Issue Bonus Shares
</div><div><strong>&gt;&gt;</strong> Write off Formation ( Preliminary Expenses)
</div><div><strong>&gt;&gt;</strong> Write off Goodwill
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>What are the different Types of Preference Shares?
</strong></div><div>&gt;&gt; Non Cumulative Preference Shares: In case company doesn’t have enough profits these shareholders will get no dividend in the year and that amount of dividend will never be given
</div><div>&gt;&gt; &nbsp;Cumulative Preference Shares : : In case company doesn’t have enough profits these shareholders will get no dividend in the year and that amount of dividend will be carried forward to next year , when the company makes enough profit the entire amount will be payable as dividend.
</div><div>&gt;&gt; &nbsp;They are recorded as non current liabilities and the dividends paid to them are treated like interest ( finance cost)
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>ISSUE OF SHARES
</strong></div><div><strong>Public Issue:</strong> This is normal issue of shares to general public. A company can issue shares to public to raise more capital , this is done at the market price. Public issues have higher cost of issue ( this means the company has to incur high expenses when issuing the shares I.e. advertising and administration ). The main advantage of issuing shares is that no interest has to be paid on it and the company only have to provide a return when they actually make profits.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Rights Issue :</strong> A rights issue represents the offer of shares to the existing shareholders in proportion to their existing holding at a lower price compared to the market value.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Advantages of Rights Issue over Public issue
</strong></div><div>&gt;&gt; &nbsp;Rights issue are cheaper to administer and less risky way of raising capital
</div><div>&gt;&gt; Shareholders will get some incentive as they will get shares at a lower price.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Disadvantages</strong>
</div><div>&gt;&gt; &nbsp;Market price will fall
</div><div>&gt;&gt; The company could have raised more funds through a public issue
.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Bonus Issue:</strong> Is the issue of shares to existing shareholders for free .When the company is short of cash and can’t give dividends so they give out shares for free to the ordinary shareholders. Other reasons for bonus issue include.
</div><div>&gt;&gt; To utilize the capital reserves
</div><div>&gt;&gt; To increase confidence in the company’s future prospects as it is normally taken as a signal of strength by the general public.
</div><div>&gt;&gt; &nbsp;When doing bonus issue company will always use capital reserves first and then the revenue reserves i.e. We can use either of revaluation reserve or share premium first but if we don’t have enough balance in both of these reserves then we will move to

</div><div><br></div><div><strong>WHAT IS CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURE/CONVERTIBLE LOAN STOCK?
</strong></div><div>Special type of debenture which can be converted into shares at a specified date. Upon conversion the debenture holder receives ordinary shares and he gives away is debenture certificate. The shares are sold to them in return of debentures, so that’s usually done at market price of share ( so share premium will be involved) . </div><div><strong>For example
:&nbsp;</strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;">A company has convertible loan stock worth $60000. They decided to convert it into shares by issuing 10 Ordinary shares of $1 each for every $15 of debenture. This means company will issue 40000 shares to settle the debenture , each share which is for $1 was sold for $1.5 .&nbsp;</span></div><div><strong>Debit:</strong> Debenture 60000
</div><div><strong>Credit:</strong> Ordinary Shares 40000 Share premium 20000

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><p>The International Accounting Standard Board (IASB) have set rules and regulation on how certain accounting transactions should be recorded and presented by a company. In most of the countries all companies are required to comply with these standards, and auditors make sure that all public limited companies are following the standards.
</p><p>The main purpose of Accounting standards is to reduce the range and variety in accounting practices throughout the world. It does not form uniform accounting basis but it does form similar accounting bases. They restrict the opportunity of frauds and creative accounting             ( window dressing) , but they cannot prevent frauds. They also assist investors to understand financial statements as the IASB issues notes and explanations of every accounting standard.
</p><p>You are suppose to remember standards with name and number . You are also required to know details of a few standards.
</p><p><strong>IAS 1 – PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:
</strong></p><p>Gives format of income statement , balance sheet and Cash flow Statements. Changes the name of balance sheet to “STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION”
</p><p>A company must report the following documents
</p><p>A complete set of financial statements includes: [IAS 1.10]
</p><p>	a statement of financial position (balance sheet) at the end of the period( see below)
</p><p>	a statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income for the period (presented as a single statement, or by presenting the profit or loss section in a separate statement of profit or loss, immediately followed by a statement presenting comprehensive income beginning with profit or loss)a statement of changes in equity for the period
</p><p>	a statement of cash flows for the period notes, comprising a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes
</p><p>	Information given should be comparative .
</p><p>Statement of comprehensive income (Total recognized gains and losses). This statement for our syllabus only includes two items.
</p><p>Profit for the Financial year ( after Tax)	xxx
</p><p>Add Gain on Revaluation of Assets	xxx
</p><p>Total Gains and Losses	xxx
</p><p>&nbsp;
</p><p>Proposed dividends for ordinary shares should be shown as a note to account and not deducted from profits ( obviously also not shown as a liability in the balance sheet)
</p><p>Redeemable shares are now treated just like debentures , they should not be included in the equity of the company, they should be shown in the long term liabilities. The dividends paid to them are now treated like interest ( Finance Cost) in the profit and loss account.
</p><p>IAS 1 also states that the following accounting principles must be applied which presenting financial statements.
</p><p>	Going Concern
</p><p>	Accrual
</p><p>	Consistency
</p><p>	Materiality
</p><p>	Offsetting ( Incomes and Expenses shouldn’t be offset against each other, Or same goes for Assets and Liabilities)
</p><p>	Prudence
</p><p>	Comparative Information ( An entity should report all the financial statements ,by showing comparison with last year statements).
</p><p>&nbsp;IAS 2 – INVENTORIES
</p><p>Stock should be valued at lower of cost or net realizable value. LIFO method is no longer acceptable.
</p><p>Valuing Work in Progress and Finished Goods
</p><p>IAS 2 requires that the valuation of these two items includes not only their raw or direct material content, but also includes an element for direct labour, direct expenses and production overheads
</p><p>The cost of these two items therefore consists of:
</p><p>	direct materials
</p><p>	direct labour
</p><p>	direct expenses
</p><p>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">production overheads, these are costs to bring the product to its present location and condition&nbsp;</span></p><p>Other overheads which may be applicable to bring the product to its present location and condition
</p><p>The cost of these two items excludes:
</p><p>	storage costs
</p><p>	selling costs
</p><p>	administration costs not related to production

</p><p><strong>IAS -7 CASHFLOW STATEMENTS
</strong></p><p>Statement of cash flows is now made under three headings 
</p><p><strong>&nbsp;Operating
</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;Investing
</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;Financing
</strong></p><p>The standard has also defined cash equivalent as :
</p><p><strong>Cash Equivalent:</strong> Cash in hand , Amount in Normal Bank account and also Amout in bank deposit account which is matured within 3 months.
</p><p><strong>&nbsp;IAS 8 ACCOUNTING POLICIES /ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES/ERRORS
</strong></p><p>Accounting policies are the specific principles, bases, conventions, rules and practices applied by an entity in preparing and presenting financial statements.
</p><p>Once an entity adopts an accounting policy then it must be applied consistently for similar transactions. An entity can change the Accounting Policy only if
</p><p>	It is required by a new Accounting Standard
</p><p>	Results in Financial statements providing more reliable and relevant information.
</p><p>Example of a change in accounting policy would changing inventory valuation from FIFO to AVCO. Or changing from Straight Line method of depreciation to Reducing Balance Method.
</p><p>As a General Rule if there is a change in policy it should be applied Retrospectively (this means all the account balances from previous years should be adjusted ,as if the new policy was always in place).
</p><p><strong>Accounting Estimates:</strong> The reasonable estimates are needed to prepare financial statements, example to determine net book value of assets. Provision for doubtful debts. Estimates must be revised when new information becomes available which indicates a change in circumstances upon which the estimates were formed. A change in Accounting estimate must be accounted for Prospectively ( example, the previous accounts are not required to be changed).
</p><p><strong>Accounting Errors:</strong> If errors from previous periods are discovered later then they should be accounted for Retrospectively  (this means all the account balances from previous years should be adjusted)
</p><p><strong>IAS 10 – Events occurring after the Balance Sheet Date ( Post Balance Sheet Events)
</strong></p><p>These are events, either favorable or unfavorable, which occur between the balance sheet date and the date on which the financial statements are authorized for issue. Such items may occur as a result of information which becomes available after the end of the year and, therefore need to be disclosed in the accounts.
</p><p>The key is the point in time at which changes to the financial statements can be made. Once the financial statements have been approved for issue by the board of directors they can not be altered. For example, the accounts are prepared up to 31 December. They are approved for issue by the board of directors on 30 April in the following year. Between these two dates, changes resulting from events after the 31 December can be disclosed in the accounts.
</p><p><strong>The statement distinguishes between two types of events:
</strong></p><p><strong>Adjusting events
</strong></p><p>If, at the date of the balance sheet, evidence of conditions existed that would materially affect the financial statements then the financial statements should be changed to reflect these conditions.
</p><p>Examples of adjusting events could include:
</p><p>	The determination after the date of the balance sheet of the purchase price or sale price of a non-current asset bought or sold before the year end.
</p><p>	Inventories where the net realizable value falls below the cost price.
</p><p>	Assets where a valuation shows that impairment is required.
</p><p>	Trade receivables where a customer has become insolvent.
</p><p>	The discovery of fraud or errors which show the financial statements to be incorrect
</p><p><strong>Non – Adjusting Events
</strong></p><p>No adjustment is made to the financial statements for such events. If material, they are disclosed by way of notes to the financial statements.
</p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Examples include:&nbsp;</span></p><p>	Proposed Dividends
</p><p>	Major purchase of assets.-losses of production capacity caused by fire, floods or strike action by employees.
</p><p>	Announcement or commencement of a major reconstruction of the business.
</p><p>	Changes in tax rates.
</p><p>	Entering into significant commitments or contingent liabilities.
</p><p>	Commencing litigation based on events arising after the date of the balance sheet.
</p><p>	Major share transactions.
</p><p><strong>IAS 16 PLANT PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT (FIXED ASSETS)
</strong></p><p>Assets must be shown at original cost less accumulated depreciation. Or the revaluation model can be applied on regular basis.
</p><p>Revaluation of assets must be consistent, if any asset is revalued all similar assets should also be revalued. All gains are transferred to revaluation reserve
</p><p>Any loss on revaluation is transferred to profit and loss (unless the asset was revalued upward before then the devaluation can be charged from revaluation)
</p><p>Once the Asset revalued is sold, the balance on revaluation reserve can be credited to retained earnings.
</p><p>This Standard has also given details of what can be counted as capital expenditure. Any cost incurred before the asset can be used is treated as capital expenditure.
</p><p><strong>IAS 36- IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS
</strong></p><p>This standard seeks to ensure that non current assets on the balance sheet are not shown at an overstated value (Including Goodwill). When Net book value ( reffered as Carrying amount) is more then its recoverable amount , the asset is impaired. An impairment loss is shown in the income statement as an expense.
</p><p><strong>What is recoverable amount?
</strong></p><p>This is the higher of the following two values
</p><p>	Current market value (Fair Value ) less cost to sell
</p><p>	Present value of future cash flows derived from the Asset ( Value in Use)
</p><p>So if net book value is above the Recoverable amount , the asset value is reduced to its recoverable Amount.
</p><p><strong>IAS 37- PROVISIONS ,CONTINGENT ASSET AND LIABLITES
</strong></p><p>Gives details on how to treat different provisions ,also gives details on contingent liabilities ( a liability which is not definite , example a company was sued by someone but the court case is still pending ) and also contingent assets ( asset which might come in for example there is court case which the company might win.)
</p><p><strong>Provisions:
</strong></p><p>IAS 37 establishes the definition of a provision as a "liability of uncertain timing or amount", and requires that all the following conditions be fulfilled before a provision can be recognized:
</p><p>	The entity currently has a liability as a result of a past event;
</p><p>	An outflow of resources is likely to be needed to settle the liability; and
</p><p>	The amount of the obligation can be estimated reliably
</p><p><strong>Contingent Liabilities:
</strong></p><p>A present obligation that arises from past events but is not recognized because the timing or amount cannot be estimated reliability . They should not be recognized but disclosed to shareholders unless the chances of them are very rare(remote) then they can completely ignored.
</p><p><strong>Contingent Assets:
</strong></p><p>A possible asset arising from past events but will be confirmed in the future. They are disclosed if the chances of occurrence are high.
</p><p><strong>IAS 38 – INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL
</strong></p><p>Intangible Assets might Include
</p><p>	Good will
</p><p>	Patents
</p><p>	Licenses
</p><p>	Franchises
</p><p>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Companies are only allowed to record goodwill , when they purchase a business . Company is not allowed to record any inherent goodwill ( goodwill of their own ) on the balance sheet. Goodwill is also tested for impairment regularly.&nbsp;</span></p><p>This standard also gives details of accounting for research and development.
</p><p>The amount of money spent on Research and development is classified into research phase and development phase. When we start doing research it is not necessary that the company will start developing the product. So if we are only doing research ( initially) the amount is treated as an expense in the profit and loss. The moment it reaches the development stage it becomes eligible for balance sheet and any further amount spent and can be shown as an asset in the balance sheet.</p><p></p></div>

        <div class="media-container-row">
            <div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><p>All of these ratios are calculated from the point of view of ordinary shareholders. It’s useful to understand the term Earning.
</p><p><strong>What is earning? (Profit attributable to ordinary shareholders)
</strong></p><p>This is Profit after Interest, tax and preference share dividend. Basically whatever goes to ordinary shareholders.
</p><p><strong>Earnings per Share
</strong></p><p><strong>Earning
</strong></p><p><strong>no of ordinary shares
</strong></p><p>How much profit after tax and preference share dividends is attributable to each ordinary share. Simply shows how much the company has earned for one ordinary share, since all the earnings belong to ordinary shareholders. Investors regard EPS as a measure of success of the company. Obviously the higher this number the more money is made by the company. This ratio allows us to compare different companies power to make money. The higher the EPS (with all else equal), the higher each share should be worth. When we do our analysis we should look for a positive trend of EPS in order to make sure the company is finding more ways to make more money. Otherwise the company is not growing. The main problem with EPS is since it is expressed on per share basis it becomes difficult to compare companies with different amount of number of shares.
</p><p>An important aspect of EPS that's often ignored is the capital that is required to generate the earnings in the calculation. Two companies could generate the same EPS number, but one could do so with less equity (investment) - that company would be more efficient at using its capital to generate income and, all other things being equal, would be a "better" company.
</p><p><strong>Dividend Per Share
</strong></p><p><strong>Ordinary Dividend Paid 
</strong></p><p><strong>No of Ordinary Shares
</strong></p><p>
</p><p>This is calculated using dividends paid . Dividends are a form of profit distribution to the shareholder. Having a growing dividend per share can be a sign that the company’s management believes that the growth can be sustained. A high Dividend per share also means the company has enough cash available to pay for dividends.
</p><p><strong>Dividend Cover
</strong></p><p><strong>Earning per Share        
</strong></p><p><strong>Dividend per share  
</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;OR
</strong></p><p><strong>Earnings
</strong></p><p><strong>Ordinary Dividend paid
</strong></p><p>This shows the relation of earning to dividends. How many times the dividend for the year can be covered (paid) from this year’s earnings. A low cover indicates future dividends are at risk if company’s profitability falls in the future ( as they are not retaining enough profits and are distributing the majority) .A high dividend cover is an indication of safety of dividends in the future ,as the company has retained enough profits. The long term investors look for high dividend cover companies, because they believe if the company is retaining more profits then they have more growth opportunities. If the ratio is under 1, the company is using its profit from a previous year to pay this year's dividend. This ratio also shows the dividend policy of the company , a high cover indicates a very conservative approach where majority of the profits are invested back in the business.
</p><p><strong>Dividend Yield :
</strong></p><p><strong>Ordinary Dividend Paid and Proposed   x100
</strong></p><p><strong>Market Price per Share	
</strong></p><p>This shows the dividends as a % of market price. This is used to calculate cash return on investment. We take investment as market price because that is the opportunity cost of holding a share. High dividend yield makes the share more attractive.
</p><p><strong>Interest Cover
</strong></p><p><strong>Operating Profit
</strong></p><p><strong>Interest
</strong></p><p>Shows how many times the operating profit can cover for the interest expense. A high ratio is desirable to this would mean company has more ability to handle its interest charges and to more amount will be available to pay for dividends. A low cover may turn a small profit into a loss due to the interest expense. Low cover also makes it difficult for the company to raise more debts and loans as the financial intuitions demand a minimum interest cover level.
</p><p>
<strong>Price to Earning Ratio&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Market Price per Share
</strong></p><p><strong>Earning per Share
</strong></p><p>This relates market price to the Earning per share. High Ratio shows the investor has more confidence in this company’s future to maintain its current level of earning , that is why they are willing to pay more . The ratio should be compared with the average ratio of the similar companies.
</p><p>Some believe that the high ratio may mean that share price is overvalued and will fall in future. But a growing PE ratio shows increase in the confidence level of investors.
</p><p><strong>Gearing Ratio
</strong></p><p><strong>Fixed Return Capital               x100
</strong></p><p><strong>Total Capital Employed  
</strong></p><p>This shows how much of the total capital employed ( total amount invested in the business) is coming from external sources (not by ordinary shareholders) . The amount of financing provided by long term liabilities and preference shareholders.
</p><p>This is measure of risk because if a high proportion is coming from these sources than majority of the profits will go as interest payments and preference dividends ( specially In the low profitability years), infact the interest expense has to be paid
&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">even in case of losses. If a company is already highly geared then its difficult to raise more loans (obviously). Gearing of more than 50% is considered high and risky.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Remember high gearing is not necessarily bad (but its risky) , it depends on risk preference of the investor. A high geared company tends to grow faster because they rely on debt and external financing, it can give amazing returns in good years but in a bad year it can also go bankrupt.
</p><p><strong>Income Gearing
</strong></p><p><strong>Interest              x 100
</strong></p><p><strong>Operating profit 
</strong></p><p>This shows how much% of operating profit has to go for interest Its same as interest cover but calculated as a %.
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Net Asset Value Per Share ( Book value Per Share)
</strong></p><p><strong>Ordinary Share Capital + All Reserves 
</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No of Ordinary Shares
</strong></p><p>This is the value of one ordinary share according to the balance sheet. Remember all reserves belong to ordinary shareholders. This indicates the amount of cash each share will receive if the company is liquated at that date. Theoretically the book value of one share should also be the market value , but market value tends to be higher because
</p><p>	Balance sheet does not include internally generated intangible assets such as human capital and goodwill.
</p><p>	Balance Sheet is historical and cant take into account future gains
</p><p>	Speculations in stock market effects the share price.
</p><p><strong>RETURN ON EQUITY :
</strong></p><p>Shows how much return as a percentage of capital is earned by the company
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>&nbsp;Earnings             x100
</strong></p><p><strong>Total ordinary share holders funds 
</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;Net Working Assets to Revenue (Sales) 
</strong></p><p><strong>Net working assets X100= %SALES
</strong></p><p>The net working assets are not liquid as cash. This calculation shows the proportion  of sales revenue that is tied up in the less liquid net current assets. A lower ratio is better which means that if sales increase the net working assets will increase in a lower rate as the company would desire to hold current assets in liquid form.
</p><p><strong>Note: Net working assets =Inventory + Trade Receivables – Trade payables

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><p>A budget is based on the objectives of a business and enables the manager to set operational targets for the department and then to control operations by comparing the actual results with those in the budget. 
</p><p><strong>ADVANTAGES OF PREPARING BUDGETS :</strong>
</p><p>	Budgets formalize management plans.  ( better planning)Co-ordinate all functions of a business. ( better planning)
</p><p>	Gives a warning for future shortages of resources.
</p><p>	Increases management participation ( while preparing budgets) which gives them a sense of commitment …&gt; motivation
</p><p>	Budgeted results can be compared with actual results
</p><p>	Cash budgets are required by financial institutions when taking finance ( loans)
</p><p><strong>DISADVANTAGES OF PREPARING BUDGETS:
</strong></p><p>	Might cause de-motivation for workers if they feel budgeted figures are way too high to achieve
</p><p>	A budget will only emphasize on results and the real reasons ( non financial) will be ignored.
</p><p>	The budgeting process will also incur cost and time.
</p><p>	There is a need to revise the budget because circumstances will change in every period.
</p><p>What is a master budget?
</p><p>A set final of accounts (profit and loss and balance sheet) prepared using figures from sales, purchases and cash budget.
</p><p><strong>TYPES OF BUDGETING
</strong></p><p>Incremental Budgeting: Incremental Budgeting uses a budget prepared using a previous period’s budget or actual performance as a base, with incremental amounts added for the new budget period. The allocation of resources is based upon allocations from the previous period. This approach is not recommended as it fails to take into account changing circumstances
</p><p>Zero- Based Budgeting: is a technique of planning and decision-making which reverses the working process of traditional budgeting. In traditional incremental budgeting, departmental managers justify only increases over the previous year budget and what has been already spent is automatically sanctioned. By contrast, in zero-based budgeting, every department function is reviewed comprehensively and all expenditures must be approved, rather than only increases. No reference is made to the previous level of expenditure. Zero-based budgeting requires the budget request be justified in complete detail by each division manager starting from the zero-base. The zero-base is indifferent to whether the total budget is increasing or decreasing
</p><p><strong>What is a principal budget factor?
</strong></p><p>Limiting factors, sometimes called principal budget factors are circumstances which restricts the activities of a business. Examples include
</p><p>	Limited demand for a product
</p><p>	Shortage of material, which limits production
</p><p>	Shortage of labor, which also limits production
</p><p>	Shortage of amount of money to be spent.
</p><p>The importance of limiting factor is that they must be identified at the start of the budgeting process. This is because all other budgets will be dependant on the limit factor. For example, if the limiting factor is demand for the product ( which is usually the case), a sales budget must be prepared and all the other budgets will than be prepared to fit in with the sales budget. But if the limiting factor is shortage of material or labour then the production budget will be prepared first and the sales budget will then be based on that.
</p><p>What steps can be taken if the cash forecast highlights future cash shortages? Please realize every action will have a disadvantage as well. So the company decides the best possible action with least effect .
</p><p>	Delay capital expenditure for a later period
</p><p>	Delay payment of dividends
</p><p>	Search for short term borrowings
</p><p>	Issue shares
</p><p>	Control expenses
</p><p>	Encourage debtors to pay earlier
</p><p>	Sell Surplus fixed assets
</p><p>	Negotiate better credit terms with suppliers
</p><p><strong>What is Flexible Budget and Fixed Budget? 
</strong></p><p>A flexible budget is a budget which is designed to change in accordance with the LEVEL OF ACTIVITY actually produced. The budget is designed to change appropriately with such fluctuation in units. Main purpose of this is to take effect of VOLUME away from the budget so that we can compare it with actual performance.
</p><p>A fixed budget, the budget remains unchanged irrespective of the level of activity actually attained. The fixed budget is prepared based only on one level of output. Fixed budget approach helps to ensure that each department within the organization always knows exactly how much they have to spend at the beginning of the period and how much is remaining at any given point during the budgetary period as the target is pre-set this may increase motivation

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><p>Standard cost is the amount the firm thinks a product or the operation of the process for a period of time should cost, based upon certain assumed conditions. The technique of using standard cost for the purpose of cost control is known as standard costing. It is a system of cost accounting which is designed to find out how much should be the cost of a product under the existing conditions. The actual cost can be calculated only when the production is undertaken. The pre-determined cost is compared with the actual cost and a VARIANCE between the two is calculated. This enables the management to take necessary corrective measures.
</p><p><strong>Advantages of Standard Costing:
</strong></p><p>	Helps in preparation of budgets.
</p><p>	Activities which are responsible for variances are highlighted
</p><p>	Variances allow management by exception to be practiced.
</p><p>	 Management by exception means that everybody is given a target to be achieved and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;management need not supervise each and everything. 
</p><p>	The responsibilities are fixed and everybody tries to achieve his/her targets.
</p><p>	As Standard cost is already calculated it helps in preparation of estimates for the cost of new &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;products and quotations for orders.
</p><p>	Motivation increases as it a target of efficiency.
</p><p>	Standards provide a benchmark against which actual cost can be compared.
</p><p>	 Managers of department with favorable variances can be rewarded.
</p><p>	 Increases workers participation.
</p><p><strong>Disadvantages of Standard Costing:
</strong></p><p>	There is cost involved in establishing and maintaining a standard costing system
</p><p>	There be may be reluctance from workforce to establish the system
</p><p>	Results in increase in admin work
</p><p>	Can de motivate ( if standards are not met constantly)
</p><p><strong>TYPES OF STANDARDS:
</strong></p><p>Standard here means expectation from your workforce.
</p><p><strong>Basic Standards:
</strong></p><p>These allow for a low level of efficiency. Workforce is not expected to be very good and low standards are kept which will allow for wastage. Basic standards are set at the initial time the company has started, as the workforce gets more trained the company will move towards more strict standards.
</p><p><strong>Attainable Standards:
</strong></p><p>These are relatively more strict than the basic standards but do allow for some wastage and recognizes that not all hours worked are productive.
</p><p><strong>Ideal Standards:
</strong></p><p>Are standards that can only be met under ideal conditions. They allow for no wastage or no idle time.</p><p></p></div>

</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div>These variances generally go in same direction, if one is favorable other one is also favorable (not every time but generally). The reason behind this is that if we use better quality material it will give a favorable usage variance , now since better quality material has less spoilage and is much easier to handle this will also save on the time consumed by labor ( hence a reduction in actual labor hours worked) which will lead to a favorable labor efficiency variance. The opposite is also true if we use relatively poor quality material.

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><p><strong>What is a consignment?
</strong></p><p>A business may want to expand its trading activities. For this purpose, it may introduce its product to the consumers of other localities, like other cities or countries. However, it may not be feasible at the initial stage to open sale terminals/branches at such places. Therefore the business may negotiate and arrange sale of goods through local businesses/retailers for a commission. This arrangement is known as a “consignment”. The business which sends the goods is called a “consignor´ and the agent whom goods are sent on sale or return basis is known as a “consignee”.
</p><p><strong>Accounting for consignment
</strong></p><p>A consignment account is made by the consignor to determine profit or loss .
</p><p>Debit side is used to record expenses and credit side is used to record incomes (Difference being the profit or loss)
</p><p>The consignor will also make an account for Consignee. This is like a trade debtor account . At the end of the contract if the payment is received this account is closed via bank ( else you can bring down the balance)
</p><p>The consignee will make an opposite account for the consignor .
</p><p><strong>Valuation of unsold goods
</strong></p><p>If there are some units unsold then we have to value them and record as Bal c/d  ( credit side ) in the consignment account . This value should include the following cost:
</p><p>	Original Cost of the goods
</p><p>	Any expenses paid by the consignor to dispatch goods to consignee.
</p><p>	Any expenses paid by the consignee to receive the goods and turn them into a saleable condition.
</p><p><strong>Note:  Expenses  like  marketing  ,  selling cost ,commission should not be included in the inventory

</strong></p><p>A joint venture is a temporary partnership. It is formed for a particular purpose and it is terminated on completion of a job or a venture for which it is formed.
</p><p><strong>For example:
</strong></p><p>	A joint venture may be formed between two individuals for construction of residential apartments. One may have expertise in construction work and the other one may provide the required finance.
</p><p>	A joint venture may be formed between a construction company and an architect firm for construction of a bridge or a housing society.
</p><p><strong>Features of a joint venture:
</strong></p><p>	It is a particular partnership.
</p><p>	It does not entail continuing features after completion of the task.
</p><p>	The business is dissolved after completion of the venture.
</p><p>	It applies cash accounting concept rather than going concern concept.
</p><p>	Calculation of incomes is relatively simple.
</p><p>	All the assets are timely received in cash and all the liabilities are paid in cash.
</p><p>	Profit is determined as the difference between cash received and cash paid.
</p><p>	It does not use a business name.
</p><p><strong>Bookkeeping methods for a joint venture:
</strong></p><p><strong>No separate books are kept:
</strong></p><p>	In a small joint venture which may expect to last for a short time period, no separate books are kept.
</p><p>	 Each party records only those transactions with which it may concern.
</p><p><strong>In the books of Harold :</strong> Joint Venture with Kumar Account In the books of Kumar : Joint Venture with Harold Account. Both parties will record Payments on the debit side and receipts on the credit side. Once all transactions are recorded , both parties will share the respective accounts with each other and a memorandum joint venture account will be prepared ( which is simply a merger of both accounts). The main purpose of this account is to calculate the profit or loss from the venture . This profit is then divided in the profit sharing ratio and transferred to individual joint venture accounts (Profit on the debit side and loss on the credit side).</p><p></p></div>

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><p>Product costing requires an accurate measurement of the resources consumed to manufacture a product. If a product is undercharged it may result into a loss to the business. Contrary to that if a customer is overcharged, there are ample chances that the business may not be able to compete and lose a customer.
</p><p>The conventional absorption costing method absorbs support overheads simply on production volume measured in terms of labor hours worked or number of units produced. In case the proportion of support overheads is quite low in total cost of a product and the manufacturing process is labor intensive, as a result, the direct costs would have been much higher than indirect costs and it may have an insignificant impact on realistic product pricing.
</p><p>However, the modern manufacturing process has become more machine intensive and as a result the proportion of production overheads have increased as compared to direct costs, therefore it is important that an accurate estimate is made for the production overheads per unit.
</p><p>The activity based costing (ABC) adopts more realistic approach to charge production overheads to determine the product cost. It charges overheads on the basis of benefits received from a particular overheads. It considers the relationship between the overheads costs and the activity which causes incurring of such costs, known as cost drivers.
</p><p><strong>Steps to calculate cost of production using ABC
</strong></p><p><strong>There are following five basic steps:
</strong></p><p>	Classify production overheads into activities according to how they are driven
</p><p>	Identify the cost driver for each activity, which causes these activities to incur the costs.
</p><p>	Calculate an overheads absorption rate (OAR) for each activity.
</p><p>	Absorb the activity costs into the product based on the benefits received by the production process.
</p><p>	Calculate the total cost of the product.
</p><p><strong>Uses of Activity Based Costing
</strong></p><p>	It is used to calculate a more accurate and realistic cost of a product.
</p><p>	It is used in an organization where production overheads form a significant portion of total cost of production.
</p><p>	It gives a better insight to consider what factors drive overheads costs.
</p><p>	It recognizes that all overhead costs are not related to production and sales volume.
</p><p>	It is used to control overhead costs by managing cost drivers.
</p><p>	It is used to apply on all the overhead costs not only the production overheads.
</p><p>	It is used just as easily as it is used in product costing.
</p><p><strong>Limitations of Activity Based Costing
</strong></p><p>	It has limited benefit if the overhead costs are a small proportion of the total costs.
</p><p>	The choice of both activities and cost drivers might be inappropriate.
</p><p>	It is more complex method of calculating the cost of a product.

</p><p>An external auditor investigates whether or not the business has kept adequate records, that financial statements are consistent with the records from which they are prepared and that financial statements prepared by management give a true and fair view of the business’s state of affairs. The auditor verifies that transactions have actually taken place and that they have been recorded in the books of account accurately.
</p><p>The audit provides the users of financial statements with an assurance that the statements provided to them can be relied upon.
</p><p>The auditor’s opinion
</p><p>If, in the auditor’s opinion, adequate records have not been kept of the company’s financial statements or the auditable part of its directors’ report is not in agreement with the company’s records and returns, the auditor will issue a qualified opinion to the report.
</p><p>A qualified report will raise points that the auditor considers have not been dealt with correctly by the directors in their preparation of the financial statements.
</p><p>Where such points are not of a serious nature, the report might state ‘...with the exception of ... the financial statements do show a true and fair view ...’ If, however, the auditor is of the opinion that there has been a serious breach the statement will state that ‘the financial statements do not show a true and fair view’.
</p><p><strong>The Audit Report
</strong></p><p>The auditor’s report has three main sections:
</p><p>	Responsibilities of directors and auditors
</p><p>a Directors are responsible for preparing the financial statements.
</p><p>b Auditors are responsible for forming an opinion on the financial statements
</p><p>	Basis of opinion – the framework of auditing standards within which the audit was conducted, other assessments and the way in which the audit was planned and performed. If the auditor fails to obtain information and explanations necessary to support his audit then this must be reported. Any deviation from the necessary disclosure requirements must be identified.
</p><p>	Opinion – the auditor’s view of the company’s financial statements.
</p><p><strong>Audit requirements
</strong></p><p>The main statements that have to be audited are:
</p><p>	The income statement
</p><p>	The statement of financial position 
</p><p>	Statement of cash flows
</p><p>	Statement of total recognized gains and losses reconciliation of movements in shareholders’ funds
</p><p>	Accounting policies.
</p><p>	Notes to the accounts.
</p><p><strong>True and fair view
</strong></p><p>A true and fair view requires that the auditor must give an opinion as to whether the financial statements presented to the shareholders are truthful and unbiased.
</p><p><strong>The auditor must verify that:</strong></p><p>● Financial statements agree with company records. They must confirm that:

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><p>Shareholders provide the capital of limited companies by the purchase of shares. In the case of public limited companies there are often many thousands of shareholders. Clearly, all these shareholders cannot run the business on a day-to-day basis, so it is the responsibility of shareholders to appoint directors to run and manage the business on their behalf. The directors of a limited company are responsible for the preparation of annual financial statements that are then used by shareholders to assess the performance of the company and the directors whom they have appointed. The directors must ensure that the provisions of the Companies Act 1985 are implemented. Directors are paid emoluments as their reward for running the business. ‘Divorce of ownership and control’ is the term often used to describe the relationship between shareholders and directors because although shareholders are the owners of a company, it is the directors who control the day-to-day affairs of the business.
</p><p><strong>Directors’ Responsibilities
</strong></p><p><strong><u>Directors have a responsibility to:
</u></strong></p><p>	keep proper accounting records that allow financial statements to be prepared in accordance with relevant companies legislation
</p><p>	safeguard business assets
</p><p>	select the accounting policies to be applied to the business books of account
</p><p>	state whether international standards have been applied
</p><p>	report on the state of the company’s affairs
</p><p>	ensure that the financial statements are signed by two members of the board of directors.
</p><p>If the directors are responsible for keeping financial records and the preparation of the annual financial statements, how can shareholders be guaranteed that the records are prepared in an objective way? Shareholders appoint a team of professionally qualified accountants (auditors) to check and verify the financial statements and the transactions that led to their preparation.
